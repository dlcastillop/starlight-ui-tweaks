  faqs={[
    {
      question: "Does this work with all Starlight themes?",
      answer:
        "Yes, Starlight UI Tweaks is designed to work seamlessly with Starlight's default theme and most custom themes. The plugin extends core components without breaking existing functionality.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will this affect my existing Starlight configuration?",
      answer:
        "No, the plugin only adds new features without modifying your existing Starlight setup. You can enable or disable features independently, and removing the plugin won't break your site.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use only some features and not others?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. Each feature is optional and independent. For example, you can add navbar links without using the footer. Configure only what you need. The only exception is changing the theme toggle, which is not configurable.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does the footer appear on all pages?",
      answer:
        "No, the marketing footer only appears on pages using Starlight's splash template. Regular documentation pages keep their standard layout while landing pages get the full marketing treatment.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does internationalization work?",
      answer:
        "All customizable content can be translated for different locales. Simply provide translations in the locales configuration object, matching the locale keys you've defined in Starlight. You only need to translate the features you're using.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize the styling of these components?",
      answer:
        "The components use Starlight's existing design tokens and styling, so they match your site automatically. For deeper customization, you can override styles using CSS, just like any other Starlight component.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does this affect my site's performance?",
      answer:
        "No, the plugin is lightweight and only adds minimal overhead. Features are implemented efficiently and follow Starlight's performance best practices.",

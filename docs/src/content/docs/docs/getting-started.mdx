Starlight UI Tweaks is a Starlight plugin that extends and customizes core UI components:

- Replaces the theme toggle with an icon-based selector
- Adds navigation links to the navbar
- Enables ads in the table of contents
- Provides a customizable four-column footer

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up. If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

<Steps>

1. Install it by running the following command in your terminal:

   <Tabs syncKey="pkg">

   <TabItem label="npm">

   ```sh
   npm install starlight-ui-tweaks
   ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem label="yarn">

   ```sh
   yarn add starlight-ui-tweaks
   ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem label="pnpm">

   ```sh
   pnpm add starlight-ui-tweaks
   ```

   </TabItem>

   </Tabs>

2. Configure the plugin in your Starlight configuration in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

   ```diff lang="js"
   // astro.config.mjs
   import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
   +import starlightUiTweaks from 'starlight-ui-tweaks'

   export default defineConfig({
     integrations: [
       starlight({
   +      plugins: [starlightUiTweaks()],
         title: 'My Docs',
       }),
     ],
   })
   ```

3. Start the development server to preview the plugin in action.
